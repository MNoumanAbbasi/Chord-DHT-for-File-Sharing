# Chord-DHT-for-File-Sharing
Distributed Hash Table based File Sharing System using Chord protocol

## Background
Chord is a distributed lookup protocol that can be used for peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing. Chord distributes objects over a dynamic network of nodes, and implements a protocol for finding these objects once they have been placed in the network. Every node in this network is a server capable of looking up keys for client applications, but also participates as key store. Hence, Chord is a decentralized system in which no particular node is necessarily a performance bottleneck or a single point of failure.

**Disclaimer**: The work is still in progress and has issues. It is in no way complete yet.
